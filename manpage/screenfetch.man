.SH BUGS
Distro detection on Windows XP and Vista is spotty and may appear incorrect.

Shell version detection relies of very specific naming schemes and may appear incorrectly if any shell changes its version scheme.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
screenfetch-c has three built-in output modes: verbose (disabled by default), error (enabled by default), and debug (disabled by default).
If a serious or fatal error occurs, the user will be notified via error (stderr).
Otherwise, the user may choose to enable the verbose and/or debug modes, which display real-time detection and minor errors respectively.

screenfetch-c returns EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE, depending on the conditions behind program termination.
