This version of screenfetch is a C rewrite of the original screenFetch, 
which was written in bash by Brett Bohnenkamper. Like the original, 
it displays both an ASCII logo determined by the computer's OS 
and a variety of statistics, including kernel type, ram, uptime, and so forth.

.SH RELEASE HISTORY
0.1 - ALPHA - INCOMPLETE, UNCOMPILED

0.5 - ALPHA - INCOMPLETE, TEST COMPILED

1.0 - BETA - LACKING MINOR PARTS, STABLE, WORKING ON MOST SYSTEMS

.SH BUGS
Distro detection on Windows XP and Vista is spotty and may appear incorrect.

Shell version detection relies of very specific naming schemes and may appear incorrectly if any shell changes its version scheme.

DragonFlyBSD systems with more than 2GiB of RAM may have their RAM stats displayed incorrectly, as 32-bit ints are used in sysctl.

Manual mode on Windows seems the result in a variety of weird bugs concerning uptime, packages, disk stats, and memory stats. For the time being, I recommend NOT using it on Windows.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
screenfetch-c has three built-in output modes: verbose (disabled by default), error (enabled by default), and debug (disabled by default).
If a serious or fatal error occurs, the user will be notified via error (stderr).
Otherwise, the user may choose to enable the verbose and/or debug modes, which display real-time detection and minor errors respectively.

screenfetch-c returns EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE, depending on the conditions behind program termination.
