screenfetch-c
=============

Current Version: 0.1 Alpha (not compiled, not complete)

screenfetch-c is an attempt to rewrite screenFetch, a popular shell 
script that displays system information and an ASCII logo, in the C 
language.
Like the original screenFetch, screenfetch-c will be capable of 
compiling and running on Windows (via Cygwin), all Linux distros, the 
four major *BSD distros, and OS X.
