screenfetch-c
=============

### Current Version: 1.1 Beta (compiled, 99% complete)

screenfetch-c is an attempt to rewrite screenFetch, a popular shell 
script that displays system information and an ASCII logo, in the C 
language.
Like the original screenFetch, screenfetch-c is meant to be compatible with a number of systems, including *BSD, GNU/Linux, OS X, and Windows (via the Cygwin environment).

### Current Status:
screenfetch-c has been extensively tested on Windows 7 (in the Cygwin environment), OS X (10.6 and 10.8), and Linux (see list below).

There are only a few select sections that still require work. They are listed here:
- GPU detection is not implemented on Linux or BSD (appears as "Unknown").
- Distro detection is not 100% complete, although it's close. If screenfetch-c fails to detect a specific distro, try running it with the -D [distro] flag.
- Package detection requires more in-depth testing on OS X (testing for MacPorts/Fink).

### Installing screenfetch-c:

Installing screenfetch-c is very simple.
First, clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/woodrufw/screenfetch-c.git
$ cd screenfetch-c
```
Then, follow the instructions for your OS:

#### Linux, BSD, OS X, and Windows:

```
make && sudo make install
```

#### Solaris and derivatives:

```
gmake solaris && sudo gmake install
```

Homebrew formula coming soon!

### Removal:
Removing screenfetch-c is just as easy as installing it:

```
$ sudo make uninstall
```

### Current Known Compatibility:

_Note:_ These are only the ones that have actually been tested (so far). screenfetch-c may very well work on many of the untested distros, so feel free to try it.
