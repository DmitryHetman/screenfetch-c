screenfetch-c
=============

### Current Version: 1.2 release (compiled and 99.99% complete)

screenfetch-c is an attempt to rewrite screenFetch, a popular shell 
script that displays system information and an ASCII logo, in the C 
language.
Like the original screenFetch, screenfetch-c is meant to be compatible with a number of systems, including *BSD, GNU/Linux, OS X, and Windows (via the Cygwin environment).

### Current Status:
screenfetch-c has been extensively tested on Windows 7 (in the Cygwin environment), OS X (10.6 and 10.8), and Linux (see list below).

There are only a few select sections that still require work. They are listed here:
- GPU detection is currently experimental on Linux and BSD.
- Distro detection is not 100% complete, although it's close. If screenfetch-c fails to detect a specific distro, try running it with the -D [distro] flag.
- Package detection requires more in-depth testing on OS X (testing for MacPorts/Fink).

### Installing screenfetch-c:

#### Dependencies:
screenfetch-c only relies on libraries that come on virtually every system.

* On Linux and Solaris, libX11 is required. In most package managers, this is listed as libX11-dev.

* On Windows, the WinAPI is required (duh).

Installing screenfetch-c is very simple.
First, clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c.git
$ cd screenfetch-c
```
Then, follow the instructions for your OS:

#### Linux

```
make linux && sudo make install
```

#### Solaris (incl. derivatives)

```
make solaris && sudo make install
```

_Note:_ For Solaris, `make` *must* be GNU make. If it isn't, use `gmake`.

#### BSD

```
make bsd && sudo make install
```

#### OS X

```
make osx && sudo make install
```

#### Windows (Cygwin)

```
make win && sudo make install
```

### Removal:
Removing screenfetch-c is just as easy as installing it:

```
$ sudo make uninstall
```

### Current Known Compatibility:
